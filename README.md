This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with React Router DOM for routing, Redux for state management, Redux Saga for side effects, and Axios for HTTP requests.

## Features

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Redux and Redux Saga
